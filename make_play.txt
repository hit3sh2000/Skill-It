step 1) It will check if gameover is T/F and board[position] !== "" then if any of this is true it will return false 

step 2) cons Currentsymbol is created which will have "O" or "X" by using symbol.option array
        and asigning the symbol to the board with following position i.e element we have clicked

step 3) Calling draw function which will map the array and diplay the symbol
    
step 4)Then calling check_winning_sequences with symbolas parameter and saving it in winning_sequence_index
        inside  check_winning_sequences we check patterns and if any patter match then consloe.log patter and return i that will be index of winner_sequences

step 5) IF winning_sequence_indexis >= 0 then calling game_is_over() function and calling stylize_winner_sequence in which 
        passing winner_sequence with winning_sequence_index and diplay the winning sequence 

step 6) IF not winning_sequence_indexis >= 0 then will calling change() funtion inside symbol object which will change
        the index i.e if index is 0 then 1 else 0
